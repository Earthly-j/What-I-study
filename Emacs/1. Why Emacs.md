I’ve tried to use many type of notes, but every trial came to an end ‘Compatibility’ point so that note writing should have similar dataset to search again.

For this Reason many cases use markdown, and I also tried to use Obsidian for note taking but it use ‘yaml’ for metadata and I feel something divided so that in future for this reason can cause incompatibility

so I stared to learn use Emacs for Ultimatum note taking. Since the Lisp (Emacs programming language) designed for fast manipulate and search, I could feel it has high potential for note taking.

And also it support **Org-Mode(like obsidian graph**) and more like CLI like manipulation and it could be all-round editor even I can use it for code editor powerfully since I develope Flutter apps Emacs can be mobile editor (because it can run on Android device) and even I don’t need Macbook 1.4kg for moving
