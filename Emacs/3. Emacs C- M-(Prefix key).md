`M-x` (Meta)
------------

**Accessing Every Command:** There are thousands of commands in Emacs, and most of them don‚Äôt have a keybinding. `M-x` is your gateway to all of them. For example, to replace a string of text, you type `M-x` and then type `replace-string` and press Enter.

### What `M-x` Actually Does

When weypress `M-x` (`Alt-x`, or `Option-x` on a Mac), a prompt appears in the minibuffer at the bottom of the screen. This prompt lets you run any command by typing its full name.

*   The command to save a file is named `save-buffer`. Its shortcut is `C-x C-s`. You can run it either way: by pressing the shortcut OR by typing `M-x save-buffer Enter`.
*   There is a very useful command named `replace-string` that searches for and replaces text. By default, it has **no shortcut**. The _only_ way to run it is by typing `M-x replace-string Enter`.

So, `M-x` is for **running** commands, not defining them.
