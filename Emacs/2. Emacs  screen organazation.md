Most modern editors (like Microsoft Word or Google Docs), the cursor is a thin vertical line `|` that sits _between_ two characters.

But In Emacs, by default, the cursor **is a block that sits _on top of_ a character**.

**Emacs each Buffer has its own Point**, if I were editing `file_A.txt` and I point is on line 50. Then I switch to another buffer, `file_B.txt`, and edit line 10. And come back to flie_A.txt then it keep remembering and locate to line 50.

Echo Area
=========

![grey part is Mode Line](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*VmKSZ40Nx-bbgsKMGUot6A.png)

It displays **Single, Multi-key commands** and Displaying Messages, Informative Messages like **Error or Progress and** Minibuffer

Mode Line

*   (Mac)- : file’s technical format
*   ** : **Modified.** `--`: **Unmodified.** `%%`: **Read-Only**
*   TUTORIAL : buffer name
*   41% : Position (how much I read )
*   L419 : Line number
*   (Fundamental) : (major) Modes

What is mode ?
--------------

only have one major mode active at a time.

**Major Mode**

*   If you’re editing Python code, you’ll be in `Python` mode, which provides syntax highlighting and indentation rules for Python.
*   `Fundamental` is the most basic major mode with **no special features.**

**Minor Modes**

An optional feature or enhancement you can turn on or off, like a plugin.

*   `Flyspell` mode would be a minor mode that adds on-the-fly spell checking.
*   `Line-Number` mode would be a minor mode that displays line numbers in the margin.

Menu bar
========

![it’s various depends on OS](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*9f0EpNan97wU1QDmWF47lQ.png)

In there we can check the keyboard Shortcut and in the **echo area** it shown which Shortcut executed. On Buffers menu we can check **which buffer is opened**

Today I dealt with basic Emacs things Point, Echo Area Mode line and Menu bar on and on I’ll keep posting Emacs fundamental.
