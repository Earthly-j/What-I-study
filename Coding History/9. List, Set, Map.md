List
----

in Dart, unlike other language , it doesn’t offer array but offer List !

```
List<String> shoppingList = ['Milk', 'Bread', 'Eggs', 'Milk'];
```

*   **Ordered**: The items maintain the exact order in which weadd them.
*   **Indexed**: We access items using a numerical index, which starts at `0`.
*   **Allows Duplicates**: We can have the same value multiple times in a `List`.
*   **Dynamic Size**: Wecan add or remove items, and the list will grow or shrink accordingly.

Set
---

*   **No Duplicates**: If you try to add an item that’s already in the set, it simply ignores it.
*   **Unordered**: The items are not stored in any particular sequence. You can’t ask for the “first” or “third” item.
*   **Fast**: It’s highly optimized for checking if a specific item exists within the collection.

**When to use it:** Use a `Set` when you just need to know if something is part of a collection, and you don't care about its order or how many times it might have been added.

**Analogy**: A list of unique tags for a blog post.

Map
---

A `**Map**` is a dynamic collection of **key-value pairs**. Think of it like a dictionary, where each unique "key" (the word) maps to a "value" (its definition).

*   **Key-Value Pairs**: Each item consists of a unique key and its associated value.
*   **Unique Keys**: Keys must be unique. If you add a new value with an existing key, it overwrites the old value.
*   **Ordered**: A `Map` remembers the order in which you inserted the keys.
*   **Fast Lookups**: You can quickly retrieve a value if you know its key.

**When to use it**: Use a `Map` when you need to store and retrieve data using a specific identifier, like looking up a user's information by their ID or storing settings as named values.

**Analogy**: The contact list on your phone, where each name (key) is linked to a phone number (value)
