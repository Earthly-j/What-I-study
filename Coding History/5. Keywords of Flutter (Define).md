Just now




Hello Guys! Today I’ll deal with Keywords of Flutter which is used in front of function name

but even not this, but also If , while, int, bool , static, all this things are called as “Keyword” and those are divided into define, control etc .. so I’ll handle this subjects today !!

Define keywords
---------------

### Function

It could be most used in Flutter codding for expression what to do for execute. and it consist with

*   local variable (int a, int b)
*   statements {print(‘hello world’)}
*   control Flow if (message.isEmpty) { print(); } else { print();}
*   Return Value return ‘Hello, ‘ + name + ‘!’;

We can understand Function as procedure Programming. Since it focused for line by line execution **it don’t ask ‘init’ like Class , Because someone Use this function right now. And I guess that when Flutter start the app with void main(**) but the other widgets consist with class

### Class

In Flutter, what we add to a class depends on its purpose, but for building UI, your classes (widgets)

*   Properties (The Data) ‘final String name’
*   The Constructor (The Entry Point)’ const ProfileCard({ super.key, required this.name,});
*   The `build` Method

Since I research, I got to know Object Programming (which using class languages) get active from ‘Small Talk’ which is used for Xerox GUI computer. Since this system can open many application, Unlike CLI computer, **Object Programming which is allocate the ‘init’ value because it need Subject keep running back ground without our attend furthermore, inside of Class function we call it ‘method’**

### Void

a function **does not return a value**. It performs an action but gives nothing back.

```
void printGreeting(String name) {
  print('Hello, $name!');
}
``````
String createGreeting(String name) {
  return 'Hello, $name!';
}
```

Historically Before C language there were no return expression but they just writing the value in the last

> About return
> 
> The functions local variable `result` is not the same as the global variable `result` that is because they are both in different “scopes”. It would calculate the result correctly (using the calculator) and local variable `result` would be correct, but it would fail to assign it to the global variable `result`.

### Variable etc..

in Flutter there is many way to allocate memory and most basic way is

```
var name = value;
```

and during the research flutter using two way save the memory first one is

*   Stack (Numbers (`int`, `double`)Booleans (`bool`)`null`) known as **value types**
*   Heap (Strings (`String`), Lists , (`List`), Maps (`Map`), All objects created from a `class`

it’s based on C languages memory allocate model but unlike C static which is a **fixed memory address but Dart is not initialized when the app starts**. Instead, it's initialized the **very first time it is accessed** in code

![this is C memory allocation, Flutter Static is not work like that](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:906/format:webp/1*khvNQAKbZYVVw19rmd3LCw.png)

Wrapping up
-----------

Today I explained about Define keywords which is very basic of Flutter But inside of basic there are deep logic is concealed !! Next Time I’ll deal with Modifier Keywords.
