Two days ago I reset my Mac for utility, But it lost the Flutter Path, so that I need to re-connect the path but it seems not smooth then I thought !

Download Rosetta

Rosetta is a translation layer that enables software built for Intel-based Macs to run on the newer ARM-based architecture

It will ask your mac user password for using sudo command

### Configure your system to develop Flutter desktop apps on macOS.

docs.flutter.dev](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos/desktop?source=post_page-----a51d069b8424---------------------------------------)

for using SDK — Software Developement Kit — We need to download that

*   Unzip the downloaded file
*   Relocate the Flutter folder to Home Directory -user name folder-

Download Sublime text
---------------------

[www.sublimetext.com](http://www.sublimetext.com) for typing some Path we need Sublime Text

Making .zshcr
-------------

Open the text editor then type export PATH=”$PATH:$HOME/flutter/bin”

Save and set the name as .zshrc

Then save on your Home directory — your user name folder

configuration file for the Z shell (Zsh), which is the default shell on modern macOS. When setting up Flutter, you modify this file to make the Flutter command-line tool easily accessible from your terminal.

`**PATH**` is an environment variable that tells your operating system where to look for executable files. When you type a command like `flutter` into your terminal, the system searches through the directories listed in your `PATH` to find the corresponding program.

$ symbol is used to get the **current value** of a variable.

Download Xcode on Appstore
--------------------------

Or you can use the command line

*   xcode-select — install

Download homebrew

Download Ruby
-------------

type the Command

brew install rbenv

then you need to add some Path value in .zshrc file before we made

eval “$(rbenv init — zsh)”

add that-just return the line and paste then save

then search best ruby version by
