Before I make some apps I didn‚Äôt know other folders except pubsec.yaml and lib folder so that I want to make clear what‚Äôs the other folders it is!

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*BKw5lkh18OV9fM4vy33FcA.png)

This folder should **never manually edit** the files inside this folder. It‚Äôs safely excluded from version control (via `.gitignore`) because it's specific to our local machine and can be regenerated at any time.

flutter_build
--------------

/777a9fd8c‚Ä¶
-----------

This long, randomly generated name is a unique identifier for a specific build configuration.

Storing build outputs here allows Flutter to reuse them, which makes future builds much faster.

App.framework
-------------

This is the compiled application bundle for **macOS**. It contains our compiled Dart code (`app.dill`) and other necessary files to run the app on a Mac. If we were building for Android or iOS, you'd see different kinds of output files here.

`.filecache`
------------

is the manifest Flutter uses to perform its **change detection**. It's the mechanism that allows Flutter to instantly know which specific files have changed since the last build, which is essential for making subsequent builds so fast.

app.dill
--------

is a **kernel snapshot** of application. is the **binary output** after this source code has been **compiled and processed.**

### Kernel snapshot, the Blueprint of Code üìù

Instead of plain text like a `.dart` file, a kernel snapshot (a `.dill` file) is a machine-readable file that contains entire program's structure. **It maps out all libraries, classes, and methods** in an organized, tree-like format

`.d`: The Dependency List
-------------------------

An ‚Äúingredient list‚Äù for a build step. It lists all the source files needed for that step.

### `dart_build`

Its purpose is to tell the build system, ‚ÄúTo create my result, I **depended on all these files.** If any one of them changes, my result is no longer valid.‚Äù

### `**flutter_assets**`

**app's assets**. It lists all the images, fonts, and other files declared in `pubspec.yaml` that need to be bundled with the app.

### kernel_snapshot_program

These are for the most important task: compiling all Dart code into the **kernel snapshot** (`app.dill`). The `.d` file lists every `.dart` file that is part of your app

### `install_code_assets`

These files are for the **task of ‚Äúinstalling‚Äù or copying** the compiled code assets (like the kernel snapshot) into the **final application bundle** that will be sent to the device.

`.stamp`: The Completion Marker
-------------------------------

A ‚Äúcompletion checkmark.‚Äù It‚Äôs a timestamp that proves a build step finished successfully at a certain time.

### `dart_build`

When the build process **successfully completes a task** (like compiling all the Dart code), it **creates or updates this** `**.stamp**`**file.** The file's existence and its timestamp serve as a marker that says, "The Dart build was successfully completed at this exact date and time."

### debug_macos_bundle_flutter_assets

bundling Flutter **assets** (like **images and fonts from** `**pubspec.yaml**`) into the macOS application.

### debug_macos_framework

**building** the main macOS application **framework** (`App.framework`), which **contains compiled code.**

### `debug_unpack_macos`

**internal setup task,** likely **unpacking a part** of the pre-compiled **Flutter engine that‚Äôs needed to build** the macOS app.

### `**gen_dart_plugin_registrant**`

This stamp marks the **completion of a code generation step.** It creates a special file (`generated_plugin_registrant.dart`) that **links any native plugins** (like `camera`, `shared_preferences`, etc.) to Flutter code so they can communicate.

### kernel_snapshot_program

These are for the most important task: compiling all Dart code into the **kernel snapshot** (`app.dill`) the `.stamp` file marks when the snapshot was successfully created.

### gen_localizations.stamp

If app uses **Flutter‚Äôs internationalization features,** this stamp marks the completion of the task that generates the necessary Dart code for handling different languages and locales.

### install_code_assets

These files are for the task of ‚Äúinstalling‚Äù or copying the compiled code assets (like the kernel snapshot) into the final application bundle that will be sent to the device.

`.json`: The Build Manifest
---------------------------

official documents or **manifests** for the build process. They don‚Äôt just mark a single point in time like a `.stamp` file; instead, they provide a detailed, structured list of information.

### `dart_build_result`

The Build Receipt üßæ ,These two files serve very different purposes in the build process. `dart_build_result.json` is a summary

### `**package_config**`

A configuration file that **tells the compiler** where to **find the source code** for every **package your app uses.**

### `**native_assets**`

A manifest that provides a **"shipping list**" of all the native C++/Swift/Kotlin libraries that **need to be linked into the final app.**

### `**outputs**`

A manifest that lists the **"finished products"** from one build step, telling the **next step which files to work with**

How They Work Together
----------------------

*   **The Inputs (**`**.json**`**)**: The process starts by reading manifests and configuration files to know what it needs to do. This is the **"What to Build"** step.
*   **The Check (**`**.d**` **+** `**.stamp**`**)**: Before starting the work, the system checks if it even needs to. This is the **"Should We Build?"** step.
*   **The Output (**`**.json**` **+** `**.stamp**`**)**: If the check determines work is needed, the task runs. When it's finished, it produces a report and marks the job as complete. This is the **"What Was Built"** step.

`debug_app.cc`
--------------

The Debug Engine Host, C++ application isn‚Äôt built from a single file. The build process has two key stages:

1.  **Compilation:** Each C++ source file (`.cc`) is compiled separately into a machine-readable "object file."
2.  **Linking:** The linker takes all these separate object files, plus any **pre-compiled libraries** (like the massive Flutter engine itself), and combines them all into the final executable application.

Outside of hashed file
----------------------

*   `**package_config.json**`: This is a critical configuration file. It provides the definitive map from a package's name (e.g., `package:http`) to its actual location on your file system. The Dart compiler and analysis server use this file to resolve all `import` statements.
*   `**package_graph.json**`: This stores the full, resolved dependency graph, showing how every package, including transitive dependencies, connects to others.
*   `**version**`: This file records the Dart SDK version used to resolve the dependencies, ensuring consistency.
