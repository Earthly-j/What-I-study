Hello guys recently I interested in primary of languages so that I bring the subject how to Compile the languages

why … Compiler language (Fortran) happen ?
------------------------------------------

In the 1950s, scientists needed to perform high-speed calculations. so that they started to make compiler and it can **high-level language compiled to machine code** could be just **as fast as Assembly language.**

*   C , C++, Rust, Go, Swift

Why… Interpreter language (Lisp) happen ?
-----------------------------------------

In the 1950s, they also need **various operating system execute program** and Interpreter language compile one line for one line, **it can be check on Real time** unlike Compiler language.

*   Bash, Shell, Lisp

> Interpret : to explain the meaning of: _synonym_: **explain**

main point of Interpreter language have VM and Python is more like Hybrid language

Why… Hybrid language (Small Talk) happen ?
------------------------------------------

**pure compiled** approach (like FORTRAN), all of their software would be locked to that specific machine. **pure interpreted** approach, the system would be too slow to run the highly interactive, graphical environment is not possible

![It was designed 1968](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:576/format:webp/1*iqjAGKhW296vB2SlfZGedw.jpeg)

> main point of Hybrid language is compiled source code into an intermediate **bytecode**.

This bytecode was then executed by a **Virtual Machine (VM)**, which made the entire environment portable across different types of hardware.

Conclusion …
------------

So from here for the first time the scientist want to **assembly to Human language** and it caused Fortran (compile language) and then it was bind by hardware.

So they **dream to make use every hardware** so that they add virtual machine (Lisp) But the speed is **not enough for portable machine** using Interpreter compiler

so they invent hybrid (smalltalk) change the **human level code to Byte code** then **execute that on Virtual Machine** some how yield both point but it can run on many hardware and enough speed for GUI
