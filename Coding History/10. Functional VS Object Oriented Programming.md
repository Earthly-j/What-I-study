First Functional Programming
----------------------------

**LISP (List Processing)**, specified in 1958 by John McCarthy at MIT, is widely recognized as the first high-level functional programming language. It was a radical departure from the procedural languages of its time, like FORTRAN, and was built on a foundation of mathematical theory, specifically Alonzo Church’s lambda calculus.

LISP introduced many of the core concepts that define functional programming today:

*   **Functions as First-Class Citizens:** Treating functions like any other data.
*   **Recursion:** Using recursion as a primary control structure.
*   **List Structures: Using a simple, powerful data structure (the list) for both code and data.**
*   **Automatic Memory Management: The concept of garbage collection was a key innovation.**

### **Not other languages treating Function as Value**

**C and its predecessors did not treat functions as regular data.**

**‘The C language provides a special mechanism called a function pointer. This isn’t the same as having a “first-class function,” but it’s the closest C gets.**

**A function pointer is a special type of variable that doesn’t hold data, but instead holds the memory address of where a function’s code begins. You can then use this pointer to call the function indirectly.**

What is benefit of using
------------------------

### Callback

```
// The function 'greet' is passed as an argument to 'setTimeout'
// 'setTimeout' will execute 'greet' after 3 seconds.
setTimeout(greet, 3000);
function greet() {
  alert("Hello after 3 seconds!");
}
```

### Function factories

```
function createGreeter(greeting) {
  // This outer function returns a new, specialized function
  return function(name) {
    console.log(greeting + ", " + name);
  };
}
// Create two specialized greeters
let sayHello = createGreeter("Hello");
let sayHi = createGreeter("Hi");
// Use the new functions
sayHello("Alice"); // Prints: "Hello, Alice"
sayHi("Bob");      // Prints: "Hi, Bob"
```

concept called **closures**, where the returned function “remembers” the environment it was created in (it remembers the `greeting` variable).

Store Functions in Data Structures

### Store Functions in Data Structures

```
function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
function subtract(a, b) { return a - b; }
// Store functions in an object
let operations = {
  plus: add,
  minus: subtract
};
let result = operations.plus(10, 5); // Call the function from the object
console.log(result); // Prints: 15
```

Objective Oriented VS Functional
--------------------------------

The fundamental difference is how they approach **data** and **behavior**.

*   **OOP** bundles data and the behavior that modifies it together into “objects.”

```
class Item {
  constructor(name, price) {
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
  }
}
class ShoppingCart {
  constructor(items) {
    this.items = items;
  }
  getExpensiveItemsTotal() {
    let total = 0;
    for (const item of this.items) {
      if (item.price > 20) {
        total += item.price;
      }
    }
    return total;
  }
}
const myItems = [  new Item("T-shirt", 15),
  new Item("Jeans", 30),
  new Item("Hat", 10),
  new Item("Jacket", 50)
];
const cart = new ShoppingCart(myItems);
const totalCost = cart.getExpensiveItemsTotal();
console.log(`OOP Total: $${totalCost}`); // Output: OOP Total: $80
```

*   **FP** keeps data and behavior separate, passing data through a series of pure functions

```
const shoppingCart = [  { name: "T-shirt", price: 15 },
  { name: "Jeans", price: 30 },
  { name: "Hat", price: 10 },
  { name: "Jacket", price: 50 }
];
const isExpensive = (item) => item.price > 20;
const getPrice = (item) => item.price;
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
const totalCost = shoppingCart
  .filter(isExpensive) // Get only items > $20 --> [{...Jeans}, {...Jacket}]
  .map(getPrice)      // Get just the prices --> [30, 50]
  .reduce(sum, 0);    // Sum the prices --> 80
console.log(`FP Total: $${totalCost}`); // Output: FP Total: $80
