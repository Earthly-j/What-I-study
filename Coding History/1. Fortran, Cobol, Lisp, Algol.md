Hello guys Recently I got to interested in Emacs Since it is designed for AI for during the research I could find how actually this computer language started

*   **Fortran (1957)** is designed for numerical computations, particularly for engineering and mathematical applications. Also it called as “Formula Translation.” and made by IBM and i assume it now days Julia or Metalab
*   **COBOL (1959)** is designed for business data processing, with a focus on readability (English-like syntax) Standardized for portability across different machines and made by U.S. Department of Defense. I assume it SQL since it using natural language like
*   **Lisp (1958)** is designed for artificial intelligence research, symbolic processing, and list manipulation.Introduced concepts like functional programming, recursion, and garbage collection, influential in AI and modern languages. It is developed by MIT I Assume nowadays Elixir
*   **ALGOL (1958)** is developed by an international committee of computer scientists, algorithmic and scientific computing, designed to be a universal, machine-independent language. I assume it successor of C to Java to Python which are nowadays for job coding

I didn’t know such a lot biased ALGOL but I could find the reason because UNIX system was too remarkable, so that C is naturally overtaken the champion title then many language stretch out from there !!
